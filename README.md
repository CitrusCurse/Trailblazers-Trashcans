# Trailblazers-and-Trashcans-TTRPG
It's a TTRPG system based on the game Honkai Star Rail....except the app is made in Splunk. I've been working on this for over a year now....I've just kept it to my local Splunk instance because I have redesigned/restructured mechanics at least 3 times now. Once it is in a more complete state, I will upload it once I rework the mechanics for all of the characters.

I am not affiliated with Hoyoverse in any way. I'm just an obsessed fan.
